## Guide

### Introduction
**Safe** is a library that implements a safe context for C++. It is an effort to provide traits for types that reduce memory leaks, double deletions and other memory errors.


### Quick start

- Requirements: C\+\+17 or later and a compatible C++ compiler.
- Choose the library type to link to your project(s).
	- If using the dynamic library version of `Safe` on Windows, only define the macro `CPP_SAFE_DYNAMICALLY_LINKED_LIBRARY_IMPORT` in consumer projects.
	- If using the static library version of `Safe` on Windows, only define the macro `CPP_SAFE_STATICALLY_LINKED_LIBRARY_IMPORT` in consumer projects.
- Select the correct runtime library version for your project(s).
	- If using the dynamic library version of `Safe` on Windows, select `/MDd` for Debug mode or `/MD` for Release mode.
	- If using the static library version of `Safe` on Windows, select `/MTd` for Debug mode or `/MT` for Release mode.

	
### Basic usage

It's straightforward to use the `Safe` library. Below are short examples that demonstrate the common APIs. These examples use a class called `Example` that inherits from `Safe::SafeContextBase`.

```c++
#include <cstdlib>
#include <utility>

class Example : public Safe::SafeContextBase //or `class Example safe`
{
private:
	unsigned long long int id;

public:
	Example()
	{
		this->id = 0;
	};
	Example(const unsigned long long int& id)
	{
		this->id = id;
	};
	Example(const Example& other) noexcept
	{
		this->id = other.id;
	};
	Example(Example&& other) noexcept
	{
		this->id = std::move(other.id);
	};
	~Example() override = default;


	Example& operator=(const Example& other) noexcept
	{
		this->id = other.id;

		return *this;
	};

	Example& operator=(Example&& other) noexcept
	{
		this->id = std::move(other.id);

		return *this;
	};

	static Example& getRandomReference()
	{
		int randomNumber = rand() % 100;
		Example* localInstancePointer = ::new Example(randomNumber);

		return *localInstancePointer;
	};

	unsigned long long int getID() const noexcept
	{
		return this->id;
	};

	void setID(const unsigned long long int& id) noexcept
	{
		this->id = id;
	};

	void setID(unsigned long long int&& id) noexcept
	{
		this->id = std::move(id);
	};
};
```

1) Allocate and construct an instance of `Example`

```c++
int main()
{
	Example* pointer = ::new Example();
	// Do not call `::delete` on managed instances. Use `Safe::SafeContextBase::recycle(...)` or the provided deallocation helpers when you need to return memory to the system. Calling `delete` on managed instances will at least cause program termination or other compilation errors with some toolchains such as Visual C++ compiler.
};
```


2) Recycle and repurpose an instance of `Example`

```c++
int main()
{
	Example* pointer = ::new Example();
	Example* anotherPointer = ::new Example();
	Example* pointerAlias = pointer;
	Safe::SafeContextBase::recycle(dynamic_cast<Safe::SafeContextBase*>(pointer)); // `pointer` is no longer meaningful after recycling.
	Example& repurposedReference = Safe::SafeContextBase::repurpose<Example>();

	return 0;
};
```

3) Create and dispose a derived chunk

```c++
int main()
{
	Safe::SafeContextBase::SafeMemoryChunk<Example>& chunkReference = Safe::SafeContextBase::createDerivedChunkOnMemoryHeap<Example>(10);
	chunkReference.dispose();
	Example& reference = chunkReference[9]; // Still valid (proxy).
	const Example& constantReference = chunkReference[9]; // Still valid (proxy).

	return 0;
};
```

4) Access a random instance in another outer scope
```c++
int main()
{
	Example& reference = Example::getRandomReference();
	cout << "ID: " << reference.getID() << endl; // Valid
	Safe::SafeContextBase::recycle(reference);

	return 0;
};
```


### Notice

- There are several limitations of `Safe` that originate from language constraints in C++. These limitations are considered "unsafe" in a similar sense to unsafe contexts in languages like C# or Rust.
- The first one is, if a type that inherits from `Safe::SafeContextBase` and also manages resource types that don't inherit `Safe::SafeContextBase`, then those resources are deemed "unmanaged" and must be managed manually (that is, in the type's destructor), just like in C#'s destructors and its `IDisposable` interface.
- If a type that inherits from `Safe::SafeContextBase` also manages resources that do not derive from `SafeContextBase`, those resources are deemed "unmanaged" and must be managed manually (for example, in the type's destructor).
- Constructors for types derived from `Safe::SafeContextBase` should be invoked using the global `new` (i.e. `::new`), not placement `new`. Manual arena allocations with placement new will likely cause crashes because the library manages and frees underlying buffers differently. This is unsafe and leads to undefined behaviors.

```c++
Example* chunkPointer = static_cast<Example*>(::operator new(sizeof(Example) * cardinality));
unsigned long long int i = 0;

for (i = 0;i < cardinality;i++)
{
	::new (chunkPointer + i) Example(); // Likely to cause a crash with this library.
}
```

- C++ doesn't provide a way to detect whether an instance was constructed with standard `new` or placement `new`, nor to determine whether a pointer still refers to valid storage. The library therefore attempts to extend object lifetimes; memory is reclaimed by recycling and repurposing instances. This approach can increase memory usage, so use it carefully.
- Another issue is casting. C++ cast operators such as `static_cast`, `const_cast` and especially `reinterpret_cast` can produce very unsafe conversions. For example:

```c++
Example* pointer = ::new Example();
void* pointer = reinterpret_cast<void*>(pointer);
delete pointer; //This is very dangerous
```

- Finally, out-of-memory conditions must be handled by the application. Large managed instances should be recycled and repurposed when they are no longer needed; the same applies to chunks. Unlike Rust where the ownership system exists, the valid references or pointers to recycled instances will potentially be meaningless and can unexpectedly modify the repurposed instances.

- All of these issues are considered "unsafe". Contexts that only use managed types are the intended safe usage.


### Thread-safety and concurrency notes

The library is implemented to be thread-safe.
